# 2.7_Assessment
Advanced computer program
- uses variables storing at least two types of data (e.g. numeric, text, Boolean)
- use sequence, selection and iteration control structures
- takes input from a user, sensors, or other external source
- produces output
- uses two or more advanced programming techniques

Advanced programming techniques
- modifying data stored in collections (e.g. lists, arrays, dictionaries)
- storing multidimenstional data in collections
- creating methods, functions, or procedures that use parameters and/or return values
- responding to events generated by a graphical user interface (GUI)
- using non-trivial string manipulation
- using addtional non-core libraries

Use advanced programming techniques to develop a computer program (Achieved)
- writing code for a progarm that performs a specified task
- using advanced techniques in a suitable programming language
- setting out the program code clearly and documenting the program with comments
- testing and debugging the program to ensure that it works on a sample of expected cases

Use advanced programming techniques to develop an informed computer program  (Merit)
- documenting the program with appropriate names and comments that describe code function and behaviour
- follwing common conventions for the chosen programming language
- testing and debugging the program effectively to ensure that it works on a sample of both expected and unexpected acnses and relevant boundary cases

Use advanced programming techniques to develop a refined computer program (Excellence)
- ensuring that the program is a well-structured, logical response to the specified task
- making the program flexible and robust
- comprehensively testing and debugging the program

Flexible and robust
- using actions, conditions, control structures and methods, functions, or procedures effectively
- checking input data for validity
- correctly handling expected, boundary and invalid cases
- using constants, variables and derived vvalues in place of literals
